# Drum_Kit
Developed an interactive web application that simulates a virtual drum kit, allowing users to play various drum sounds by clicking on-screen buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. The project emphasizes hands-on experience with front-end development technologies and user interface design.
